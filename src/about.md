  Hey there! I am Luca DeCaprio, a front-end developer from Toronto Canada. I push pixels at a loyalty platform called <a href='http://www.mopals.com' alt='Mopals Link'>Mopals</a> as a senior frontend engineer. We do fun stuff such as React Native and AngularJS.
  
  I've previously worked for some big names such as Gaylea Canada, RBC and Owens Corning and many little guys along the way. Fortunately through my ventures I've had the luxury of developing on and with some backend frameworks such as ASP.NET, Laravel and Ruby On Rails. Although I don't classify myself as a backend developer I am confident I know enough to dabble comfortably.
  
  My passion is frontend and I plan on learning everything I can to be the best that I can be at creating beautiful, functional and scalable front-end applications!
