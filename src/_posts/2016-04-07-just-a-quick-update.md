Ola! Things have been crazy the past few months so its taken awhile, but after a few cups of green tea and some commits, viola! decapr.io is born.

To get started, I just want to talk about the design of this site. Design is not my strength and I will be the first to admit that. However, I value good design so I've been investing my time in learning it, hopefully its payed off. I believe my simplistic design compliments my personality, I like to keep it simple. Over complicating features, design or ideas leads to poorly thoughtout solutions. I like to cut straight to the point and deliver results.
 
Coming very soon, I plan on adding a portfolio page which will illustrate my competence to implement pixel perfect design, functionality and most importantly, bringing a product to life.
