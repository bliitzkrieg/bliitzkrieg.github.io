  Hey there! I am Luca DeCaprio, a front-end developer from Toronto Canada. I push pixels at a loyalty platform called <a href='http://www.mopals.com' alt='Mopals Link'>Mopals</a> as a senior frontend engineer. We do fun stuff such as React Native and AngularJS.  
  
  Welcome to my personal blog and portfolio. Although not rich in content currently, I plan on sharing interesting challenges, thoughts and rants I experience throughout my dev life. Occasionally I may blog about the video game industry as I am a very big gamer.
