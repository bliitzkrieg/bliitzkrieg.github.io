Things have been crazy the past few months so its taken awhile, but after a few cups of green tea and some commits, viola! decapr.io is born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started, I just want to talk about the design of this site. Design is not my strength and I will be the first to admit that. However, I value good design so I’ve been investing my time in learning it, hopefully its payed off. I believe my simplistic design compliments my personality, I like to keep it simple. Over complicating features, design or ideas leads to poorly thoughtout solutions. I like to cut straight to the point and deliver results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming very soon, I plan on adding a portfolio page which will illustrate my competence to implement pixel perfect design, functionality and most importantly, bringing a product to life. If you’re interested in checking that out, follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lucadecaprio&quot; target=&quot;_blanks&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>Ola!
